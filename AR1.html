    <p>After the burst of COVID-19 crisis, online society becomes a part of our lives. The isolation makes hard for people to join the community and stay connected. Zoom is a popular app that often used to have meetings and classes.</p>
    <p>We now have zoom filters like virtual backgrounds and face cartoon-like filters.</p>

    <h2>Online Society through AR</h2>
    <p>AR makes the online society more fun and engaging. With the face cartoon filters, students are more enjoyable when having meetings in school clubs. Zoom has the green screen that you can add photos you like to be your virtual background. It can also be animated background that shows like a video. With these virtual backgrounds, people can hide their privacy if they prefer to not reveal their actual background. Since we cannot have physical interactions online via Zoom, the AR effects bring people an innovative and immersive feel.</p>
