  <p>Augmented Reality, or “AR”, is exactly what you would expect – technology designed to augment your reality. Unlike virtual reality, in which users step into new virtual worlds, AR brings digital content into your existing environment. Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.</P>
  <p>AR can be defined as a system that incorporates three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. The overlaid sensory information can be constructive (i.e. additive to the natural environment), or destructive (i.e. masking of the natural environment). This experience is seamlessly interwoven with the physical world such that it is perceived as an immersive aspect of the real environment. In this way, augmented reality alters one's ongoing perception of a real-world environment, whereas virtual reality completely replaces the user's real-world environment with a simulated one. Augmented reality is related to two largely synonymous terms: mixed reality and computer-mediated reality.</p>

  <p>AR is widely used in architecture and urban design. It can gives designers a better overall view of the blueprint before actually building the architect. It is often used when customers want to construct an interior design. Customers can have a more intuitive feeling of the design with AR. </p>

  <p>AR is used in service and maintanance. Since some equipments have delicate and complicated components, it is easier to see the small details with AR. AR can better ensure the safety of facilities and instruments.</p>
